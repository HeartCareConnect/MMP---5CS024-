@HeartCareConnect (MMP)

Throughout the project, I've had the privilege of working with a team of highly skilled and active colleagues.
Choosing valuable team members from the start had a positive influence on the outcome of HeartCareConnect. 
So, to assist the caregivers, we created an all-in-one platform where elders could be monitored, 
engage in community discussions, or book/request specific appointments.
